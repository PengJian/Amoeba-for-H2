/**
 * <pre>
 * The invoker is used to invoke self-contained units of code on an
 * invoking thread. Each invoker is associated with its own thread and
 * that thread is used to invoke all of the units posted to that invoker
 * in the order in which they were posted. The invoker also provides a
 * convenient mechanism for processing the result of an invocation back on
 * the main thread.
 * &lt;p&gt; The invoker is a useful tool for services that need to block and
 * therefore cannot be run on the main thread. For example, an interactive
 * application might provide an invoker on which to run database queries.
 * &lt;p&gt; Bear in mind that each invoker instance runs units on its own
 * thread and care must be taken to ensure that code running on separate
 * invokers properly synchronizes access to shared information. Where
 * possible, complete isolation of the services provided by a particular
 * invoker is desirable.
